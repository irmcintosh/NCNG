## Overview

The **NCNG Web Map Template Saver** is a custom ArcGIS Online companion application developed for the **North Carolina National Guard (NCNG)**.  
Its primary purpose is to allow authorized users to quickly and consistently save standardized copies of ArcGIS web map templates, following NCNGâ€™s naming and organizational conventions.

This tool streamlines the process of creating operationally consistent maps by enforcing title formats, folder organization, and tagging conventions.

## Purpose

Operational mapping within the NCNG requires **consistency**, **speed**, and **organization**.  
This application was designed to:

- Save copies of official NCNG web map templates to a user's ArcGIS Online content.
- Apply **naming conventions** that follow the format:
- - Default certain fields (like **Fiscal Year**) to reduce repetitive manual input.
- Allow users to **select an existing folder** or **create a new folder** for storage.
- Support **tags**, **summaries**, and **descriptions** to improve discoverability in ArcGIS Online.

## Features

- **ArcGIS Online Authentication** â€“ Secure OAuth 2.0 PKCE sign-in.
- **Auto-generated Titles** â€“ Based on NCNG operational naming standards.
- **Default Fiscal Year** â€“ Automatically populates the current NCNG fiscal year.
- **Folder Management** â€“ Choose existing folders or create new ones directly in the app.
